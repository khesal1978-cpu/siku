Build a mobile-first web app called “PingCaset” (you can replace the name later) — a user-friendly crypto-style mining app inspired by Pi Network and Interlink Network, with a premium and futuristic look.

The MVP version should include:

🔹 1. Onboarding & Auth

Splash screen with app logo and tagline

Signup/Login with email, Google, or phone number

Referral system (unique referral code per user)

Dashboard tutorial popup on first login

🔹 2. Mining Dashboard

Beautiful real-time counter showing “Mining Balance”

Tap to mine button (like Pi Network “Lightning” button)

Show mining speed, total mined, and active mining time

Daily mining reset timer

Optional boost buttons (Invite more users, social share, etc.)

🔹 3. Referral & Network System

“My Team” page showing referred users (direct & indirect)

Leaderboard (top miners globally & regionally)

Referral bonus system integrated with mining speed

🔹 4. Wallet (MVP)

Show total mined coins

Show transaction history (even if mock data)

Withdraw button (inactive in MVP, grayed out)

🔹 5. UI/UX & Theme

Clean, premium dark UI with neon blue, purple, and gold gradients

Glassmorphism + neumorphism combo for buttons and cards

Rounded edges, smooth animations, and subtle particle effects

Responsive for both mobile and desktop

🔹 6. MVP Backend (if using database)

Firebase or Supabase for authentication and user data

Track mining progress in database

Store referral network links

Admin panel for user stats and control (optional MVP)

🔹 7. Extra Features (optional but good for show)

“Community” tab (links to Telegram or Discord)

“Announcements” or “News” feed section

“Profile” section (with editable username, country, invite code)
